Weather Forecast app gets weather forecast data from third-party service Open-Meteo (https://open-meteo.com).
To show weather forecast relevant to device's current location this app collects location data. Location data
is sent to Open-Meteo directly from your device, exposing your IP address to Open-Meteo. When you use search location by name functionality this app collects device's language information and sends it to Open-Meteo in order to request and show search results in device's language. Weather forecast data and location data may be saved locally on the device to improve service, e.g. load forecast data faster. Beyond that, Weather Forecast does not collect, send and/or share any data.
